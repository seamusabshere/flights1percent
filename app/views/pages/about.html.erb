  <h3>What?</h3>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p><a href="http://1v99.org">1v99.org</a> is about highlighting the difference between the 1% and the 99% objectively and visually. We have started off with Air Travel (Private Jets vs Economy) and Homes (Mansions vs non-Mansions). We plan to launch further studies in income and consumption. We plan on opening the site to the public to add their own examples of 1v99 soon (we are looking for developers to help with opening the platform :).</p>
  <p>We invite you, the 99%, to enjoy, share with friends, and participate.</p>

      <h5>Designer</h5>
      <p>Founder and designer at <a href="http://thepublicsociety.com/">The Public Society</a>, illustrator, maker, doodler, I started my life with a pencil in hand and never stopped imagining. Nearly 20 years of multi-disciplinary experience in graphic design, illustration and typography for a broad range of clients from non-profits and start-ups to Fortune 500s coupled with a fierce interest in the psychology of identity and a strong desire to make a difference through design led me to imagine a branding and visual communications company. When I'm not at work I'm definitely off disciplining cats with my girlfriend, a fellow cat herding professional.</p>
