* Shortly after our group got together, we decided we wanted to focus on using hard numbers to quantify the difference between the "1%" and the rest of us.

* We came up with the idea of the 1v99.org site, which would have various "modules" that examined specific aspects of "the gap." Since we were at an environmental hackathon, we were going to begin with a couple environment-focused topics: transportation and housing.

* We knew we wanted to make our analysis data-driven, and a few of us had good experience with the Brighter Planet environmental impact calculation API (CM1), so we set out to find datasets that we could perform calcluations on that would reveal the disparity we all expected to find.

* We all really like a dataset that the Wall Street Journal had assembled which contained individual flight records for all of the private jet traffic between U.S. airports going back to 2007.

* At first we thought we'd just calculate the impact of all of these flights, and compare it on a per-capita basis with the impact of standard commercial flight traffic over the same time period. But we realized our analysis would come across better if we picked out individual people--members of the 1%--that the viewer could compare herself to.

* This is where things got a bit trickier, but in true hackathon spirit we made it work. We started by identifying about 15 famous people known for their use of private jets. By looking at various blog posts and inspecting photographs of these folks standing in front of their planes, we were able to construct a rough database of which "tail numbers"--aircraft ID numbers--were owned by each celebrity.

* By running all this data through the Brighter Planet API we could have calculated a rough idea of each of our selected 1%er's flight footprint. But--again in the spirit of hackathons--we wanted to get it right. We knew, for example, that one of John Travolta's private jets was a bona fide 747, not a little Leer jet that sips jet fuel, but a real guzzler. Until we were able to tie each flight to the actual model of aircraft used, the picture would still be incomplete.

* So we did some digging and ended up cross-referencing both our celebrity aircraft database and the Wall Street Journal private jet records database with a third dataset, the FAA aircraft registry, which links tail numbers to aircraft models. The Brighter Planet API can accept these model codes and derive a specific "fuel effiency" (kind of like mpg) value for them, so we ended up with a much more accurate representation of these footprints, and with additional contrast among the celebrities.

* The results were even more ridiculous than we had expected. The Koch brothers--choice villains of the Occupy movement--weighed in with a footprint over 6,000 times that of an Average Joe. We did cheer when the calculations were completed for favorites of ours like Morgan Freeman and Bob Dylan and came out fairly low--21x and 42x average, respectively.

* Next, we wanted to get a picture of the impact of some of the 1%ers' colossal homes. There wasn't a great single dataset for this, so we pulled details from various corners of the internet--a blog post, for example, told us that Bill Gates' house has 7 bedrooms and 24 (!) bathrooms.

* We ended up with a database of about 15 home-sweet-homes, owned by folks like Mayor Bloomberg and Tom Cruise. The results this time were in some ways more down-to-earth--Derek Jeter's house, for example, makes an environmental impact only 18 times that of a run-of-the-mill abode. Just goes to show how skewed our perceptions got running the flights analysis.

* We're hoping that we can keep producing more modules like these, breaking down the difference between the 1% and the 99% in a data-driven way. The whole project's open source, so if anybody would like to get involved, please get in touch: we're @1v99org on Twitter.
